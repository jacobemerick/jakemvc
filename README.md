# jakemvc
A simple, custom MVC that powers several of my personal sites, including a [blog](http://blog.jacobemerick.com/), [lifestream](http://lifestream.jacobemerick.com/), and [waterfall directory](http://www.waterfallsofthekeweenaw.com/).

### Overview
This is an ancient codebase (started back in 2008) that has somehow survived multiple half-rewrites and changing coding preferences. The original intent was to send all requests - static, dynamic, and server-side - through a single point to make easy bootstrapping. Oh, and to support many different types of websites through a single MVC directory.
