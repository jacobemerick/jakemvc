  <div class="introduction">
    <p>Howdy! You've found my online portfolio. My name is Jacob Emerick and I am a software engineer who works remotely for Shutterstock. I specialize in backend application architecture and development, though I also have frontend, management, and data science skills as well.</p>
    <p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy backpacking, hiking, reading, and rough-housing with my two sons. I do spend a lot of time coding, though, for both work and open source. My current areas of focus are&hellip;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service-Orientated Architecture patterns</li>
      <li>APIs, particularly with spec design</li>
      <li>Backend Javascript development</li>
      <li>Continuous Integration workflows</li>
      <li>Modernizing PHP applications</li>
      <li>Machine learning</li>
