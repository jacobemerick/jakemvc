	<h2>Want to know more about Jacob Emerick, his websites, or this framework?</h2>
	<p>Well, let's start with Jacob. He's a a web developer living in Appleton, WI with his wife Katie Reynolds. Jacob currently works remotely for New York-based <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/" target="_blank">Shutterstock</a> as a backend engineer. When he's not coding he enjoys hiking in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</p>
	<p>These websites are created mostly just to share information (kinda like what the internet is for...). It's one thing to use social networks or traditional blogging platforms and another to be able to optimize a site around the content and user experience. Jacob also likes to experiment with these sites, using different code techniques or DOM structures to find optimal practices.</p>
	<p>That leads into the framework. There ain't no Wordpress or Joomla here - this is one-hundred-percent custom. Having the opportunity to play with a variety of different PHP frameworks out there, Jacob prefers to build his own from scratch. There may be several strong influences (cough cough Ruby on Rails) but the backend code is unique and, most importantly, fun to work in.</p>
